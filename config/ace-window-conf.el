;; This magnificent package takes care of this issue. Itâ€™s unnoticeable if
;; you have <3 panes open, but with 3 or more, upon pressing C-x o you will
;; notice how your buffers turn a solid color and each buffer is asigned a
;; letter (the list below shows the letters, you can modify them to suit your
;; liking), upon pressing a letter asigned to a window, your will be taken
;; to said window, easy to remember, quick to use and most importantly, it
;; annihilates a big issue I had with emacs.

;; An alternative is ace-window,
;; however by default it also changes the behaviour of C-x o even if only
;; 2 windows are open, this is bad, it also works less well with exwm for
;; some reason.
